            sunset view of Sydney, Australia
            Sydney is a cosmopolitan city surrounded by iconic beaches, world heritage sites, and acclaimed wine regions.
            
            Besides being Australia’s largest city, Sydney is also its most visited. (And, contrary to popular belief,
             not the country’s capital!).
             Few people skip the city — and why would they?
            With an incredible variety of attractions, beaches, restaurants, and sights to see, it’s easy to see why people 
            come here and stay a while! There’s so much to do here. Try to stay at least a week if you can. I never, 
            ever get tired of visit Sydney!
             It’s amazing. Be sure to also spend some time on the lesser visited North Shore beaches.
            This Sydney travel guide will help you make sense of all the things to see, show you where to stay, and help you save money.

        <h2 class="heading">When to Go to Sydney</h2>
        <div class="image">
            <p class="left">
                September to the end of November and March to
                May are the best months tovisit Sydney. These are the shoulder seasons, when temperatures are 
                pleasant and you don’t have to contend with the huge tourist crowds.
                Airfare is also cheaper during this time.
                September to the end of November is right before peak season, 
                so there will be some crowded places. But overall the temperatures are 
                between the low 50s°F (10°C) to the mid-70s°F (24°C). Fall season 
                (March-May) is much the same, so you’ll want to pack a light jacket
                for those chillier days.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Top 5 Things to See and Do in Sydney</h2>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                <h3>1. Hang out at the bitches </h3>
                From Palm Beach and Manly to the famous Bondi and Coogee, Sydney has a beach for everyone. 
                    All the beaches are easy to get to via public transportation and there are tons of restaurants around. 
                    My favorite beaches are Manly (wide and beautiful) and Bronte (small and quiet).
                <br>
                <br>

            <li><h3>2. See the blue mountains</h3>Over the millennia, the sandstone here has been weathered
                 into gorges lined by steep cliffs and narrow ridges. See the magnificent rock formation the 
                 Three Sisters or hike the many trails for excellent views of sheer rock walls, tumbling waterfalls, 
                 and magnificent forests. 
                The park is free and you can get there by train from Sydney (90 minutes).
                <br>
                <br>

            <li><h3>3. Visit wildlife sydney zoo</h3>The Wild Life Sydney Zoo is set up with highly detailed,
                 “natural” environments for birds, wallabies, reptiles, and more. There are various guided tours 
                 and animal feedings all day. 
                This is a good family activity. Admission costs is 36.80 AUD($28 USD).
                <br><br>

            <li><h3>4. See the sydney opera house </h3></li>The Opera House is famous for its white-shelled roof.
                It’s an architectural delight and feat of engineering as getting the roof to stay up took the creation
                of a complex support system. Guided tours cost 42 AUD ($32 USD) and last one hour, 
                providing tons of insight into how this iconic building came to be.
            <br><br>

            <li><h3>5. Walk the sydney harbour bridge</h3></li>The bridge was built in 1932 as a government employment 
            project during the Great Depression. Its steel frame has become an iconic symbol of the city. While tours 
            that climb the bridge are expensive (198 AUD/$150 USD),
             it’s free to walk or bike across it for panoramic views of the harbor and Opera House.
             <br><br>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="heading">Other Things to See and Do in Sydney</h2>

        <p><h3>1. Visit The Rocks</h3>The Rocks is the oldest part of Sydney. With its narrow lanes, colonial buildings,
             sandstone churches, and Australia’s oldest pubs, this neighborhood is where Sydney started when the British 
             first landed. It was almost torn down in the 1970s for modern high-rises, but, luckily, citizen action got it
              preserved instead. The Rocks’ weekend markets, art museums, street entertainment, delicious (and sometimes overpriced) 
              restaurants, and beautiful views of the harbor, Opera House, and bridge make this is one of the coolest areas 
              of the city. I love heading up to the Sydney Observatory Hill Park 
            for a good view of the city, wandering the harbor promenade, and hitting the bars at night.<br>
            <br>
            <h3>2. Botanic Gardens & Mrs. Macquarie Chair</h3>You’ll find Australia’s first vegetable garden and a treasure 
            trove of trees, ferns, flowers, and gardens at the Royal Botanic Gardens. On a sunny day, you’ll find locals sprawled 
            out all over the lawns soaking up the sun. You can also see Mrs. Macquarie’s Chair, a seat carved into a stone cliff, 
            where you can sit and gaze out at the harbor. 
            There are also free one-hour volunteer-guided tours of the garden, too! Admission is free.<br><br>
            <h3>3. Ferry to Manly Beach</h3>The ferry ride to Manly offers sweeping views of the harbor, Sydney Harbour Bridge, 
            and the world-famous Opera House. It’s a picturesque 30-minute ride each way that puts you in one of the coolest parts 
            of the north end of the city. Manly is famous for its wide beach, 
            giant waves, surfing, and kick-ass nightlife. Ferry tickets are 9.90 AUD ($7.50 USD).<br><br>
            <h3>4. Take the Town Hall tour</h3>Built in 1889, Sydney’s beautiful Town Hall is a picturesque Victorian building. 
            They offer a detailed two-hour tour for only 10 AUD. It’s a great way to learn some extra history 
            about the building and its place in the greater tapestry of Sydney’s history. Tours only available on weekdays.<br><br>
            <h3>5. Go to the museums</h3>Like most cities, Sydney has a wide variety of museums. And, luckily, thanks to Australia’s
             Commonwealth past, all the public museums in the city are free, making it a great and inexpensive activity in an otherwise
              expensive city. My favorite museum in Sydney is the Hyde Park Barracks. Set in the old convict barracks from the 18th 
              century, it does an amazing and detailed job of chronicling colonial life in Sydney, using the stories of the early 
              settlers, historical information, artifacts, and historical recreations. It’s well worth the 19.20 AUD entrance fee. 
              It’s always the highlight of my trip. Few people visit, making it one of the best non-touristy things to do in the city!

            Other museums in Sydney worth visiting are the Art Gallery of New South Wales (modern art), the Museum 
            of Contemporary Art Australia at The Rocks (contemporary art), the Australian National Maritime Museum 
            (maritime history), the White Rabbit Gallery (contemporary Chinese art; also has a teahouse), the Hyde 
            Park Barracks Museum (local, criminal, and judicial history), and the Museum of Sydney (local history).<br><br>
            <h3>6. Learn to surf</h3>Sydney is often the place travelers bite the bullet and learn the art of Australia’s 
            famous national pastime. There are many companies here that offer lessons. While Bondi is the most popular 
            beach, Manly on the north shore of Sydney has better waves (though you can find good waves up and down the 
            coast!). Surfboard rentals start at 12 AUD ($9 USD) per hour while two-hour group lessons cost around 75 AUD ($57 USD). 
            Umina Beach, Collaroy Beach, and Corrimal Beach are good beaches for beginners.<br><br>
            <h3>7. Visit the Hunter Valley</h3>North of town is one of Australia’s premier wine regions. The Hunter Valley 
            is home to amazing wineries that produce luscious reds. While it’s not as easy on the budget, it is an excuse
             to get out of the city and see the countryside. Day tours are offered from Sydney but they are expensive 
             (150-200 AUD/$115-152 USD) and you’ll spend a lot of time on a bus.
             It’s best to stay for at least a night out in the valley to get the full experience.<br><br>
            <h3>8. The Tower Sky Walk</h3>At 286m, the Sydney Tower Skywalk is as tall as the Eiffel Tower and twice as
             high as the Harbour Bridge. It offers amazing panoramic views of the city from its Skywalk at the top. 
             I’m not a fan of heights but even I was impressed by the view! At 59.80 AUD ($45 USD), 
            it’s cheaper and easier than climbing the bridge itself (and the views are actually better).<br><br>

            <h3 class="heading">Where To Stay in Sydney</h3>Some of my favorite hostels in the world are in Sydney!
