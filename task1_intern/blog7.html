        <h2 class="title">Seychelles</h2>
        <p>When I think of what heaven would look like, I think of Seychelles. I mean, look at that picture above! It just doesn’t 
            look real. But it is 
            and that’s what makes me salivate every time I think of these beautiful islands located off the east coast of Africa.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, isolation and a pristine environment come with a price, and a visit to Seychelles isn’t cheap. 
            This is not a budget destination. Seychelles is a country that caters to honeymooners, celebrities, and high-end tourists.
            Fortunately, in recent years, a few budget options have 
            appeared (thank you Airbnb!) but, for the most part, you’re going to find this a place hard on your wallet.
            This travel guide to the Seychelles will help you plan a trip there and give you ways to save money.

        <h2 class="heading">When to Go to Seychelles</h2>
        <div class="image">
            <p class="left">
                The best time to visit Seychelles is between April-May and September-October. The islands will be less
                 windy during this time and perfect for watersports and lounging on the beach. Temperatures here sit 
                 around 30°C (86°F) all year round, though it’s often breezy so it doesn’t get too humid.
                Since different trade winds affect the island at different times of the year, certain islands are better
                 than others depending on which winds are blowing. May-November will be less windy on the west side of the 
                 islands while the rest of the year will be less windy on the eastern coasts.
                From January-March, you can also see the baby turtle hatching and making their way out to sea. They start
                 nesting and laying eggs in October.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">THINGS TO DO AND SEE SEYCHELLES</h2>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                <h3>1. Relax on the beach </h3>
                The beaches here are uncrowded, untouched, and void of any structures. They are beach heaven. The water is clear 
                and warm so it’s always
                 a great place to go swimming or snorkeling. Don’t miss Anse Source d’Argent, Anse Lazio, and Beau Vallon beaches.
                <br>
                <br>

            <li><h3>2. Explore vallee de mai</h3>This is a national park and UNESCO World Heritage Site on Praslin. It is home to 
                a stunning array of flora and fauna, including the rare Coco de Mer (sea coconut), which
                 can only be found in two places in the world. You can also see several varieties of latanier palms and screw pine.
                <br>
                <br>

            <li><h3>3. Climb morne blanc</h3>Located in Morne Seychellois National Park, this is a fun and challenging hike that
                 takes you through tea plantations all the way to 
                a panoramic view spot above the island. Visit in the morning to beat the clouds. It takes just under an hour to climb.
                <br><br>

            <li><h3>4. Visit Aldabra atoll </h3></li>Stretching at over 20 miles in length, this UNESCO Site is one of the largest
             raised coral atolls in the world. It’s considered 
            the original habitat of the giant land tortoise too. The atoll requires a special permit to visit.
            <br><br>

            <li><h3>5. Enjoy the food</h3></li>Seafood, coconut, and curry are among some of the main staples on which you can 
            feast. Coco Rogue is considered a 
            ‘secret spot’ by locals and offers some of the best food around. Bonbon Plume is another popular place to go.
             <br><br>
        </ul>
        <br>

        
        <h2 class="heading">Other Things to See and Do in Seychelles</h2>

        <p><h3>1. Get active</h3>After lounging on the beach, spend some time enjoying the island’s recreational activities.
             Golf, squash, snorkeling, kayaking, badminton, SUP, tennis, and hiking are all readily available and affordable. 
             Kayak and SUP rentals start at 540 SCR ($30 USD) per day while you can rent snorkeling gear for around 180 SCR 
             ($10 USD) per day. Bring your own snorkeling gear if you want to save money.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>2. Explore Cousin Island</h3>Just over a mile southwest of Praslin, Cousin Island is a protected nature reserve. 
           The native bird population here exceeds 300,000! Opened in 1968 specifically to preserve the bird populations, here you
            can walk through the thick forest and check out all the different bird species. 
           Keep your eyes peeled for the endangered Seychelles Magpie Robin. Admission is 500 SCR per person.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>3. Hike Nid d’Aigle</h3>The highest point on La Digue, this hike is a fantastic way to spend a day. The sweeping views
            of La Digue and of the neighboring islands are magnificent. It’s a 4km hike with 333m of elevation. Most people complete 
            the hike in 1.5-2 hours.
            Remember to pack plenty of snacks, sunscreen, and water. Aim to hike in the morning before it gets too hot<br>
           <br>
           <h3>4. Visit L’Union Estate</h3>Back when coconut farming was the main industry on La Digue, this was the center of 
           production. Just south of La Passe, the estate is now a national heritage site and is run as a sort of informal 
           museum/theme park. There are some demonstrations involving how the coconuts were harvested and you can explore the 
           Old Plantation House, the colonial-era graveyard, 
           and the boatyard. There’s even a pen housing giant tortoises. Admission is 100 SCR ($6 USD) per person.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>5. Search for the Veuve Bird</h3>La Digue is home to the Veuve Nature Reserve, which was set up specifically to protect
            the Veuve (the black paradise flycatcher). It’s a small purple and black bird that’s endemic to the island and critically
             endangered. There are less than 300 left in Seychelles as habitat loss has destroyed their traditional ecosystem. You can arrange 
           guided tours which are guaranteed to find the bird. Admission is 150 SCR ($8 USD) and 200 SCR ($11 USD) with a guide.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>6. Check out the Natural History Museum</h3>If the weather is less than perfect (unlikely), take break from the beaches 
           and visit the Natural History Museum in Victoria (on Mahe). It’s small but worth a stop if you’d like to learn a thing or 
           two about the island’s wildlife and geology. The museum highlights all the flora and fauna on the island and there are also 
           exhibitions on the island’s military and militia. The museum also focuses 
           on the environmental issues and natural disasters that threaten the nation’s future. Entry is 15 SCR ($1 USD).<br><br>


            <h3 class="heading">Where To Stay in Seychelles</h3>There are no hostels here so you’ll need to stay at 
            budget-friendly guesthouses. Here are a few suggestions to help you get started:<br>
            Liane de Mai (La Digue)<br>
            Calou Guest House (La Digue)<br>
            Villa Kayola (Mahe)<br>
            La Rocaille (Mahe)<br>
            Seashell (Praslin)<br>
