        <h2 class="title">Maldives</h2>
        <p> The Maldives are the epitome of island paradise and the dream destination of pretty much everyone you ask â€“ seriously,
            ask anyone around you right now if theyâ€™d want to visit the Maldives. ðŸ™‚
            These pristine, beautiful islands in the Indian Ocean are a haven of natural beauty and one of those places that definitely lives 
            up to the hype, as we got to discover recently.
            Prior to booking our flights, I hadnâ€™t really done much research into the Maldives (it was just one of those places 
            I knew I wanted to go to) and shortly after booking, I soon realised how it was a lot trickier than I initially
             anticipated. Thereâ€™s a lot more choice than I realised, so many things you should pack (and so many thing you 
             shouldnâ€™t), local laws I had no clue about and a whole range of activities those pretty Pinterest photos never
              seem to highlight.
            To that end, Iâ€™ve put together this guide to helping you plan your stay in the Maldives. Some stuff might seem 
            more obvious than some other but hopefully, each of these will 
            help you make the most out of your time in one of the most beautiful places on earth!
            </p>

        <h2 class="heading">GOING BETWEEN ISLANDS</h2>
        <div class="image">
            <p class="left"><br>
                Booking a stay at more than one place in the Maldives is a great way to cram in as many new experiences 
                as possible in your time there (even the snorkelling will be different). Each island is unique and moving
                 around helps you relive the excitement of discovering somewhere new <br>in the Maldives. I canâ€™t recommend 
                 it enough. <br>(Plus, you get to be smug when
                 others are leaving for home and youâ€™re just transferring to your<br> next stunning Maldivian island).
                 Flights from whatever country youâ€™re travelling from to the Maldives is fairly straight-forward and no different than
                  booking a flight from say, London <br>to Paris.

                 The getting to the islands is the bit you need to remember to sort out and plan ahead.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">WHAT TO SEE AND DO</h2>

        <p><h3>1. Go snorkelling.</h3>Even from beach in front of you, you jump right in can straight away start to 
            experience the beautiful and rather varied Maldivian wildlife<br>
           <br>
           <h3>2. Have a romantic meal.</h3>Private island dining, candlelit dinner by the beach, special villas â€“ the choices 
           are endless. Choose one and make it special.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>3. Go swimming with sharks.</h3>Swimming with whale sharks is definitely one of those unique experience youâ€™ll be 
           talking about for ages but even if you 
           arrive out of season, you can still go swimming with black tip sharks who are around pretty much all year round.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>4. Take a guided tour with marine biologist.</h3>Snorkelling on your own is great but going with an expert is so 
           much better. They spot things you might otherwise miss and are able to help you make the most of your experience here.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>5. Go on a sunset tour.</h3>If youâ€™re lucky, youâ€™ll see some dolphins while youâ€™re at it too. Even 
           if you donâ€™t, the sunset here is absolutely incredible and goes down quite well with a few glasses of 
           champagne.<br>
           <br>
           <h3>6. Have a spa day.</h3>You donâ€™t even need to over-think this one. Just do it.<br><br>
           <h3>7. Go swimming with manta rays.</h3>Like whale sharks, manta rays are huge and very impressive
            to see in the wild. The Maldives is the perfect place to see them though you do have to visit in season for this. ðŸ™‚<br><br>
           


           <h3 class="heading">WHERE TO STAY</h3>
           <p>We search far and wide for where to stay and came up trumps on when it comes to amazing places to stay in the Maldives. Here are our recommendations on where
                to stay and why (in no particular order and absolutely backed by our personal experience):</p><br>
                1. Dusit Thani Maldives<br>
                2. Angsana Ihuru<br>
                3. Kurumba Maldives<br><br>

            <h3 class="heading">WHAT TO EAT</h3>
            <p>In our experience, the food in the Maldives will be the least of your worries. Every place has a lot of variety on offer and if you 
                have specific dietary requirements, inquire in advance though youâ€™ll be hard-pressed to find a place that canâ€™t cater to you.</p>
