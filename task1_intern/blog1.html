        <h2 class="heading">THINGS TO DO AND SEE IN HONG KONG</h2>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li>
                1. One of the best places to see how incredible Hong Kong looks is at The Peak on top of 
                the Peak Tower. The Peak Tram goes to the bottom of this incredible wok-shaped observation tower, 
                and then a climb to the top offers stunning views over the city, harbour and mountains. There are
                 also shops and museums here along with nice walks around the tower. Another way to see Hong Kong 
                 is a trip on the Star Ferry around Victoria Harbour which can also be particular 
                good at night from the ‘symphony of lights’ show from the harbour-front buildings. <br>

            <li>2. Hong Kong offers many museums and one of the best is the Hong Kong Museum of History in Kowloon. 
                This museum has a great way of bringing history to life with large mock-up galleries offering a 
                glimpse of Hong Kong’s colonial past. Other museums include Honk Kong Museum of Art exhibiting
                 Chinese ceramics, terracotta and paintings;
                 and the interactive Hong Kong Science Museum great for children. 

            <li>3. Lantau Island offers a welcoming break from the incredible lights and sounds of Hong Kong. 
                The island offers a fantastic array of attractions including open countryside, beautiful beaches,
                 fishing villages, monasteries and on the way to the island you may even be fortunate to see rare 
                 Chinese White Dolphins, which are in fact pink. The island also features the world’s tallest outdoor
                 seated bronze Buddha and one for the children – Hong Kong Disneyland. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 class="heading">EATING OUT & NIGHTLIFE IN HONG KONG</h2>

        <p>There are many good bars and restaurants in Hong Kong which cater for a wide range of culinary tastes 
            including Chinese, Asian, Cantonese and also Western dishes. Many restaurants are clustered in defined 
            Dining Districts and these include Stanley, SoHo, Lamma Island and Lei Yue Mun. Dim Sum is possibly the
             best known Cantonese dish served throughout the day and typically in bamboo baskets with Chinese tea. 
             If you’re going to use chopsticks try to avoid using them vertically in your bowl of rice as this is
             reminiscent of incense sticks burning with connotations of wishing death to people around you.<br>
