        <h2 class="heading">Weather in Paris</h2>
        <div class="image">
            <p class="left">Paris has a temperate climate with marked difference <br>between seasons. Summers are warm 
                and winters are cold, though not to extremes. Rainfall is moderate and steady year round. The city is 
                known for its sudden rain showers. Paris <br>has an average temperature of around 40° F in winters and around 
                70°F during the summer months. A pullover and a<br> warm Jacket should be sufficient to take care of the winter 
                chill. However, there can be a brisk change in temperature at any time of the year in Paris. Carrying 
                a scarf or a stole as an accessory is a practical as well as stylish thing to do. Paris is known to receive 
                frequent showers that dry away quickly. Carrying a small umbrella during any season is a good idea. 
                A comfortable pair of walking shoes is a must for Paris.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">WHAT TO EXPECT IN PARIS</h2>
        <ul type="circle">
            <li><h3>Language:</h3> While some people may speak English or other European languages, French is by far the
                     most spoken language in the city.
                <br>

            <li><h3>Currency:</h3> The Euro is the currency throughout France and in many other European countries.
                <br>

            <li><h3>Credit Cards and Banks:</h3> All tourist areas will have ATMs with most hotels and restaurants accepting credit cards, although it is wise to carry some cash as small retailers may not take cards.

                You’ll find that cafes and shops are more expensive the closer they are to the main attractions such as the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triumph. Walk a few blocks
                 from the main areas to find more authentic and less expensive establishments!<br>

            <li><h3>Climate:</h3> The weather in Paris is generally quite mild for most of the year, with a reasonable amount of rain throughout the year.

                Cold season: Daytime temperatures between November and February rarely get above ten degrees Celsius, but seeing Paris in the snow can add a whole new dimension to this lovely city.
                
                Hot season: July and August are usually the hottest months in Paris.<br>

        </ul>



        <h2 class="heading">Museums in Paris</h2>

        <p>Paris is passionate about its art and aesthetics. We’ve often heard of well-known artists and authors 
            drawing inspiration from the beautiful city of love. Which is why, it comes as no surprise that Paris 
            is home to some of the most oldest and prominent museums in the world. From architecturally beautiful 
            to plain informative, the city is not short of museums that display some of the most remarkable artwork 
            from renowned artists. And, what makes them worth a visit is the impressive collection of culture that 
            is displayed under one roof. Considered as nothing less than the realm of artistic vibrancy, 
            tourists can feast their eyes to a visual treat with every art hub they visit in Paris.</p>


        <h2 class="heading">Best Cabarets in Paris
        </h2>

        <p>Rhinestones, feathers, sequins, and, of course, the French can-can, the dazzling world of cabaret has
             been a significant part of Parisian culture since the 19th century. Initially established as a creative
              hub where musicians, dancers, writers, poets and artists gathered to socialize and discuss their work
               over a few drinks, the first ‘cabaret’ 
            - Le Cabaret Artistique - quickly grew in popularity, inspiring many more venues of its kind.</p>

        <h2 class="heading">Seine River Cruises
        </h2>
    
        <p>We’ve often talked about Paris being one of the most romantic destinations in the world. However, what 
            makes an experience worth remembering is not just the cobbled stone streets and the quaint, roadside 
            cafes that Paris hides, but also its majestic waterways and the river Seine. While we’ve always associated 
            Venice with enchanting boat rides, opting for a river cruise in Paris can help you view the city of lights 
            from a unique perspective. This unforgettable tour that is unlike any other will take you through the history 
            of Paris through a relaxing tour. Whether you’re the kind who prefers taking in the amorous views of the 
            city with a glass of champagne, or the kind who simply wishes to view things 
            from a different panorama — visiting Paris is incomplete without a Seine river cruise</p>
